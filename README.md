Fish community trait dissimilarity dampens synchronizing effect of environmental fluctuations 
Irving et al

Trait based synchrony analysed with multi membership models

Note that - 
scripts 1-4 are calculations of sychrony and data formatting
Script 8a is the main script for models and figures

## script 01_single_traits_interpolated_abundances_new_cwm.R

calculates community weighted means and variance. 

## 01a_single_species_sites.R

finds sites with only a few species and removes

## 02_sync_single_traits_groups_cwm_cwv_interpolated.R

thermal community synchrony and temperature synchrony calculated

## 03_distance_connectivity.R

calculates distance between sites and identifies sites within same basin

## 04_format_sync_data.R

format for statistical analysis

## scripts 05-07

old/explotatorty code not used in final analysis

## Script 08a_tidy_analysis_cortemp.R

Main bulk of stats
multi memebership mixed models on all 3 models 
all figures for results
